# ðŸ“… Day 3 â€“ Arrays & Hashing Completion + Two Pointers Begins (NeetCode Roadmap)

Today I completed the last problems from Arrays & Hashing and began exploring the Two Pointers pattern. Some problems challenged my logic and shifted how I think about time complexity. Others felt intuitive, which showed me how much Iâ€™ve already absorbed!

### âœ… Problems Solved

- [36. Valid Sudoku](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-sudoku/)
- [128. Longest Consecutive Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/)
- [125. Valid Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/)
- [167. Two Sum II â€“ Input Array Is Sorted](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/)

### ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways

#### ðŸ”¹ Valid Sudoku
- Using `unordered_set` for rows and columns was easy
- 3Ã—3 grid logic was tricky â€” mapping `i, j` to sub-boxes took time
- Instead of copying a solution, I struggled and figured it out myself â€” worth it

#### ðŸ”¹ Longest Consecutive Sequence
- Sorting was tempting but not optimal (O(n log n))
- Learned that nested loops can still lead to O(n) if controlled correctly
- A key lesson on how **total work** matters more than appearance

#### ðŸ”¹ Valid Palindrome
- Applied converging two-pointer logic confidently
- Used `isalnum()` to skip unwanted characters
- `tolower()` helped handle case-insensitive comparison
- Felt smooth and straightforward after my earlier learning

#### ðŸ”¹ Two Sum II (Sorted Array)
- The logic just **clicked** â€” two-pointer felt natural
- Solved efficiently on a sorted array by moving left/right pointers
- Great confidence boost to see previous patterns pay off

ðŸŽ¯ Today balanced deep logic struggles and intuitive wins. Iâ€™m excited to dive deeper into Two Pointers tomorrow!
